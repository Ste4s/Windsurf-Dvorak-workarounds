# Windsurf-Dvorak-workarounds

Scripts to work around non-US keyboard layout issue in Windsurf IDE.

As referenced by the the [Codeium forums](https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/p/changing-the-ctrl-hotkey-that-switches-to-write-mode), here are scripts to work around the issue with non-US keyboard layouts and the Windsurf IDE Cascade panel:

- [init.lua](init.lua): configuration for HammerSpoon (macOS).
- [windsurf-keys.ahk](windsurf-keys.ahk): configuration for AutoHotkey (Windows).

My response:

# Detailed Installation Instructions

## For macOS Users
Install Hammerspoon:
- Download from https://www.hammerspoon.org/
- Move Hammerspoon.app to your Applications folder
- Launch Hammerspoon and allow accessibility permissions when prompted

Create or edit ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua with the code from [init.lua](init.lua).

Reload Hammerspoon (click the Hammerspoon menubar icon â†’ "Reload Config").

## For Windows Users

Install AutoHotkey v2:
- Download from https://www.autohotkey.com/
- Run the installer
- Choose to install AutoHotkey v2 (not v1.1)

Create a new file named windsurf-keys.ahk with the code from [windsurf-keys.ahk](windsurf-keys.ahk).

Double-click the file to run it (you'll see the AutoHotkey icon in your system tray). Put the AHK script in C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup to have it start when you log in (alternative method: press Win+R to open the Run dialogue and type `shell:startup` to open the Startup folder). 

## Linux

Linux users can almost certainly do the same using an equivalent tool, perhaps something like AutoKey, xbindkeys, KHotkeys, etc (if you build it, please post the code here).
